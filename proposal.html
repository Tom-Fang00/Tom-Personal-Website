    <ul>
      <li>What is the website about?</li>
      <p>
        The website is about an imaginary restaurant named "Shao Lin". The
        restaurant will feature a "Zen" theme and will likely be vegetarian.
      </p>
      <li>What is the objective of the website?</li>
      <p>
        The website is just for general information of the restaurant, to
        educate potential customers about the culture and food of "Shao Lin".
      </p>
      <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
      <p>
        Target audience will be all those that want to experience some high end
        vegetarian cuisine.
      </p>
      <li>What content do you plan to include in each of your website?</li>
      <p>
        There will be a main page that serves as a directory. There will be a
        meet the team and the menu option from the main page. From the menu
        page, there will be a list of menus for different days and each direct
        to a new page of different menu. There will also be a not functional reservation page.
